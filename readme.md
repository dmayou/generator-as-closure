# Generator Functions As Closures
When I learn a new high-level concept, I often feel more comfortable if I can think of it from its lower-level underpinnings.

Although I don't know for sure that ES6 generator functions are implemented as closures under the hood (off to the transpiler!), I thought that I would learn them better if I could rewrite a few generator function examples as closures.
